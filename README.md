So after I went through some Python via MOOC FI course I felt I got a solid grasp of what programming is and... I like it. I set myself to explore what I would like to learn and do and decided to go for some system level/low-level programming. I am eternaly thankful to Python for giving me intro into this hole world but I really like the idea of something like C/Zig/Rust so that's where I'm going. I got myself a book called Effective C by Robert C. Seacord and am currently going through it. I like it because it's not overly long and correctly (in my case) assumes I know at least something about basic programming concepts. So far I am having a lot of fun trying out and playing with all C has to offer. This repo contains all I have learned so far and will be adding more as I go.
